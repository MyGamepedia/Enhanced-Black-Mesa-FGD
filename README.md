## What is Enchanced Black Mesa FGD ?

This is heavy improved Black Mesa FGD from [TeamSpen's HammerAddons](https://github.com/TeamSpen210/HammerAddons). This project is at development stage, planned to be announced together with the release of one of my projects.

## How to install ?

1. Install TeamSpen's HammerAddons at first. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/TeamSpen210/HammerAddons/wiki/Installation).
2. Download [latest](https://github.com/MyGamepedia/Enhanced-Black-Mesa-FGD/releases/latest) version of `Enchanced Black Mesa FGD`.
3. Drop archive files into your `Black Mesa` folder with files replacement (if it will ask).
4. Make sure that your `gameinfo.txt` include `hammer` folder and that Hammer use `blackmase.fgd` without the original files from the game files.
5. Enjoy!
