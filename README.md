## Enchanced Black Mesa FGD

These are FGD files improved by me for the game Black Mesa. It's currently at a very early stage and I plan to improve it further. The goal of the project is to make life easier when working with the Black Mesa Hammer. 
Adds missed I/O and kayvalues. Adds entities that are available in the game, but which you can't find in Hammer. Removes garbage, entities that doesn't exist in the game, broken or unused I/O and key values. Adds spheres, fixes model preview, etc.
